# geosight
This here is the project GeoSight code repository. GeoSight aims to provide tactile maps of the University of Colorado Boulder's campus, where the vision-impaired can get a better gauge of campus layout. 
The code is written in the Adruino IDE, compromised of the DFPlayerRobotMini library and the Adruino's C-based programming language.
