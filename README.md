# Project GeoSight
This is the project GeoSight code repository. GeoSight aims to provide tactile maps of the University of Colorado Boulder's campus, where the vision-impaired can get a better gauge of campus layout. 
The code is written in the Adruino IDE, compromised of the DFPlayerRobotMini library and the Adruino's C-based programming language.

## What is This Project?
GeoSight aims to create an immersive, **tactile map** experience for vision impaired people. Currently, **CU Boulder** does not have a method for vision-impaired people to holistically understand the layout of the campus. In essence, the university lacks any large-scale map for the vision impaired to use on campus. With GeoSight, this is made possible with a 3D printed map of the main campus that contains buttons and braille labels for the major campus locations. Pressing the buttons provides audible feedback about the location, specifically information about the building use, and anything relevant to vision-impairment. Interacting with the physical map helps build cognitive awareness of the campus, plotting its details. With the addition of audio feedback, this further completes this cognitive awareness with a deeper understanding of the features and use of the building.
